1. Give the report a new title and add your own name
2. Make a plot of average IMDB ratings per season
3. Find the highest and lowest IMDB ratings for any episode of The Office
4. Include an image from The Office somewhere in the report

Here's a plot of average IMDB rating for each season of The Office.
```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Load library
library("dplyr")
library("ggplot2")

# Load The Office data from this URL:
# https://raw.githubusercontent.com/melaniewalsh/Neat-Datasets/main/TheOfficeIMDBPerEpisode.csv
# This data is drawn from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kapastor/the-office-imdb-ratings-per-episode
office_df <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/melaniewalsh/Neat-Datasets/main/TheOfficeIMDBPerEpisode.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Which season of The Office was the best?
# Calculate the average IMDB rating for each season
rating_per_season <- office_df %>% 
  group_by(Season) %>% 
  summarize(avg_rating = mean(Rating, na.rm = TRUE))
pull(rating_per_season)

# Now plot the average IMDB rating for each season as a scatterplot, a line plot, or both
# Your ggplot code here
ggplot(data = rating_per_season) +
  geom_line(mapping = aes(x = Season, y = avg_rating))
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Find the highest IMDB rating for any episode of The Office and pull the value
highest_rating <- office_df %>% 
  filter(Rating == max(Rating, na.rm = TRUE))
pull(highest_rating, Rating)

# Find the lowest IMDB rating for any episode of The Office and pull the value
lowest_rating <- office_df %>% 
  filter(Rating == min(Rating, na.rm = TRUE))
pull(lowest_rating, Rating)
```

The highest IMDB rating for any episode of The Office is `r highest_rating`, and the lowest rating is `r lowest_rating`.
